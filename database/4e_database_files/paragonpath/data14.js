Students of this school harness the power of the Elemental Chaos to unleash devastation against their enemies.<br>    For centuries the anarchs defended the genasi realm against the draconic empires. They also served to check the power of Shyran lords when the rulers of that land veered toward tyranny. The order fell apart when the anarchs lost their way and turned to meddling and kingmaking. A handful of masters who remained true to the order's ancient purpose preserved the anarch teachings. When Abeir and Toril merged briefly during the Spellplague, anarch disciples brought this ancient tradition to Faerûn.<br>    In the decades since, the way of the Shyran anarchs has spread slowly across Faerûn. Schools devoted to this path can be found in Akanûl, Aglarond, Calimshan, and the Dragon Coast. The anarchs of Shyr are no longer a unified society, and no longer serve Shyr—but a few still honor the old ways.<br><br><h3>ANARCH OF SHYR PATH FEATURES</h3>    <b>Blade Flurry Action (11th level)</b>: When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also make a melee basic attack after you resolve that action.<br>    <b>Empowered Aegis (11th level)</b>: When you use your aegis of assault immediate reaction, you gain a +2 bonus to your melee basic attack roll.<br>    <b>Extended Aegis (16th level)</b>: The range that the attacker must be within for you to use your aegis of assault immediate reaction increases to 20 squares (from the normal 10 squares).<br><h1 class=encounterpower>Lightning Clutch<span class=level>Anarch of Shyr Attack 11</span></h1><p class=flavor><i>Tendrils of lightning course from your hand into your blade, linking you and your foe.

Now you face the fire.\"</i></p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord, Bravura Presence class feature<br><br>A dragon driven to wrath is a terrifying foe. It stops at nothing to quench its fury in the blood of those who wronged it. Only the desire to protect its young can drive a dragon to even greater heights of recklessness. A dragonborn warrior is little different, and a dragonborn officer displays parental loyalty to those alongside whom he fights. Such is the dragonborn warrior ideal.<br>    An exemplar of this standard was Dhuryan Flamebrow, an audacious but beloved dragonborn mercenary from the fringes of the empire of Arkhosia. Dhuryan was noble born, but upon him fell the consequences of his father's dark deeds. Without title or property in the empire, and living under the shadow of family history, he made his way as a soldier and leader. He made a habit of leading from the front with a brashness born of being indifferent to death. Glory and the erasing of the past was his overriding aim, yet he was unwilling to sacrifice his fellow fighters for his own gain.<br>    Dhuryan succeeded in reshaping the armies of a border province known for its barbarism and monster problems. Eventually, that province and its dragon lord became the most prominent in Arkhosia, although only Dhuryan's name is widely remembered to this day. At long last, Dhuryan had cleansed his family name. He rose then to prominence as a military advisor and became a general in the wars that eventually destroyed Arkhosia. During this time, he penned the military manifesto titled Flamebrow, in honor of his clan. Myths from many cultures say that Dhuryan fought in numerous wars in this world and beyond, and that he fell but returned to life more than once. Tales say that he stands now beyond the touch of time, alongside other legendary generals, awaiting the world's need.<br>    Flamebrow still exists, copied into many languages. It is a treatise for the commander who wishes to defeat enemies head-on. Although it speaks of deceptive planning and long-term strategies, it also talks of brutal efficiency and courageous leadership when battle is joined.<br>    Whether through influence, reading and practice, or direct training, your path has been influenced by Flamebrow.
